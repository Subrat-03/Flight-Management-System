• Historically, Flight Management System involved extensive paperwork, making it
susceptible to errors and challenging to maintain. The need for a more efficient and
accurate system led to the development of computerized solutions. The C++ program
under consideration is a response to this need, aiming to simplify the process and
reduce the burden on airline companies.


• The Flight Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to
streamline the process of managing and organizing passenger’s data within airline
companies. Developed using C++, this project aims to provide an efficient platform
for user/admin to input, store, retrieve, and analyse passenger’s information such as
customer details, destination airport and other information.


• The system will feature a user-friendly interface allowing authorized personnel to
easily navigate through functionalities like booking records, updating records,
deleting records, view records. Robust data security measures will be implemented
to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive customer details.


• The project's core objectives include enhancing administrative efficiency, facilitating
accurate record-keeping.
